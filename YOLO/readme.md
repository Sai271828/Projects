# YOLO Loss Function Project

This repository contains a project where I implemented the YOLO (You Only Look Once) loss function ([Redmon et al. 2016](#ref1)) for object detection tasks.

## Overview
YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection system known for its speed and accuracy. This project focuses on implementing the YOLO loss function and applying it to the [Pascal dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/).

## Results
The repository includes sample results obtained from training the YOLO model using the implemented loss function in the [Yolo Notebook](https://github.com/Sai271828/Projects/blob/master/YOLO/Yolo%20notebook.pdf).

## References
This project is based on the work described in "You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection" by [Redmon et al. 2016](#ref1).
