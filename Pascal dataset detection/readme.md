**Convolutional Neural Networks**

In this project, we will use Convolutional Neural Networks to classify images in [Pascal dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/).
In [Alex Net](https://github.com/Sai271828/Projects/blob/master/Pascal%20dataset%20detection/Alex_net.ipynb), we use the Pretrained Alex net. We then fine tune it to classify images in Pascal dataset.
In [Custom CNN](https://github.com/Sai271828/Projects/blob/master/Pascal%20dataset%20detection/customCNN.ipynb), we use a custom CNN to classify images in Pascal dataset. Note that this takes s signifcant amount of time. I used GCP instances to train this netwrok. Training it on your computer can take significantly longer.
